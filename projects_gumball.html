      <h1>Scrap Gumball Machine</h1>

<div class="projectsindividualthreeimg">

      <img src="img/projects/gumball/gumball.gif" alt="Finished Gumball Machine" />

</div>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      The project was to create a gumball machine out of materials available at home.<br><br>
      Materials Used: <br><br>
      • Gelato container<br>
      • Cardboard boxes<br>
      • Tape<br>
      • Acrylic paint<br>
      • Screw lid<br>
      • Top Coat<br>
      • Wooden skewer<br>
    </p>

    <p>This was originally my manufacturing project (cancelled due to the virus), and the design
      that was followed was using the youtube video below:<br><br></p>
      <iframe width="320" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q3ZeUNDg4fQ"
      frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
      allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <br><br>


  <p>Since this diy project had to be scaled down, there were modifications made to the
    design shown in the video.</p>
    <br>



    <p>I started off by finding a container to fit the sizings of the rest of the mechanism against.
      I chose to use a gelato container because it was the largest clear container with a lid that I had.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, I had to cut out the bottom of the gelato container. The plastic was too hard to cut
      using a box cutter, so I had to hammer in a square awl around the circumference until the
      plastic was cut out. Although this worked, it produced very jagged and sharp edges
      that could not be filed down with the tools I had. Therefore, I resorted to duct taping the edges
      to prevent injuries.

    </p>

<div class="projectsindividualtwoimg">
    <img src="img/projects/gumball/awl.jpg" alt="Square awl to cut" />
    <img src="img/projects/gumball/awlcut.jpg" alt="Circular cut using awl" />
</div>

  <p>
    I decided to use the top of the gelato container as a tray to hold the container. I
    used a box cutter to cut the top, which was made out of hdpe and very easy to cut.
  </p>

<div class="projectsindividualtwoimg">
  <img src="img/projects/gumball/topcut.jpg" alt="Cutting the tray" />
  <img src="img/projects/gumball/video_tray.jpg" style="max-width:40%" alt="Tray reference" />
</div>

<p>
  Next, I created the part shown below using cardboard. I was not too sure what its function was
  until I assembled the whole machine and realized that it was to stop gumballs from continuously
  falling into the hole and out the chute when the hole was aligned with the chute exit.
</p>

<div class="projectsindividualtwoimg">
<img src="img/projects/gumball/bottom.jpg" alt="Bottom cover" />
<img src="img/projects/gumball/video_bottom.jpg" style="max-width:40%" alt="Bottom reference" />
</div>

<p>
  I used layers of cardboard to make the disk that carries the gumball. The edges of the cardboard were
  fuzzy and coming apart, so I sanded them down and coated them using a nail top coat.
</p>

<div class="projectsindividualtwoimg">
<img src="img/projects/gumball/disk.jpg" alt="Disk" />
<img src="img/projects/gumball/video_disk.jpg" style="max-width:40%" alt="Disk reference" />
</div>

<p>
  I noticed that to hold all of these layers of cardboard, the tray had to be deeper. Therefore,
  I used scrap cardboard to add height to the tray.
</p>

<div class="projectsindividualoneimg">
<img src="img/projects/gumball/addheight.jpg" alt="Adding height to the tray" />
</div>


<p>
  I then initially put the parts together to observe how they move together.
</p>

<div class="projectsindividualtwoimg">
<img src="img/projects/gumball/rotation_1.gif" alt="Rotation 1 animation" />
<img src="img/projects/gumball/rotation_2.gif" alt="Rotation 2 animation" />
</div>

<p>
  To rotate this using a mechanism, I needed a gear system. I cut out another disk and used hot glue
  to attach a total of 18 teeth. I then wanted one rotation of the spur gear to rotate the disk
  a third, so I created a spur gear with 6 teeth. I did not bother to measure the disk or spur gear
  teeth location and size too accurately, and just hoped it would turn our more or less okay.
</p>

<div class="projectsindividualtwoimg">
<img src="img/projects/gumball/gears.jpg" alt="Gears" />
<img src="img/projects/gumball/video_gears.jpg" style="max-width:40%" alt="Gears reference" />
</div>

<p>
  Next, I created a chute for the gumball to fall. I made it a right angle chute to make it easier to make, but realized
  I had to add a slanted piece inside in order to force the gumball to roll out of the chute.
</p>

<div class="projectsindividualtwoimg">
<img src="img/projects/gumball/chuteslant.jpg" alt="Chute with a slant" />
<img src="img/projects/gumball/video_chute.jpg" alt="Chute reference" />
</div>

<p>
  I then cut out cardboard to start making the base where all of the components would be
  assembled. I hot glued a rectangularly scored sheet of cardboard around a circular piece
  that I cut to fit the opening of the tray.
  As I put together some of the parts to see how they work, I realized that
  the chute has to have a smaller opening in order to accommodate the mechanism that will
  turn the disk (marked in green).
</p>

<div class="projectsindividualtwoimg">
<img src="img/projects/gumball/chute.jpg" alt="Base stand with chute" />
<img src="img/projects/gumball/basestandmarked.jpg" alt="Base stand marked" />
</div>


<p>
  I then attached the spur gear to a square-shaped rod that I created out of cardboard and passed
  it through a lid of a different container. However, I realized that with the current setup, the
  rod droops downwards because the only point of contact for the rod is the hole through which
  the rod is passed through, since the inside is hollow. Therefore, I added a cardboard piece
  to hold the rod up properly.
</p>

<div class="projectsindividualthreeimg">
<img src="img/projects/gumball/drooprod.jpg" alt="Drooping rod" />
<img src="img/projects/gumball/droopfix.jpg" alt="Drooping fixed" />
<img src="img/projects/gumball/droopfix2.jpg" alt="Drooping fixed 2" />
</div>


<p>
  However, I noticed that the gear can still move around. Therefore, in order to limit its movement,
  I added a small rod to pass through the gear rod to hold it axially. This worked well, as the gear rod
  was hollow inside. It was still difficult to attach after I had already fixed the rod however.
</p>

<div class="projectsindividualoneimg">
<img src="img/projects/gumball/gearaxis.jpg" alt="Fixing the gear on its axis" />
</div>

<p>
  I then tested out whether the gear mechanism works. Although it got stuck every once in a while,
  given that I took very few measurements, it worked much better than I expected. For every full
  rotation of the spur gear (when the part marked "top" makes a full 360), the disk more or less
  rotates a third, starting from a closed position and ending at a closed position.
</p>

<div class="projectsindividualtwoimg">
<img src="img/projects/gumball/rotation_4.gif" alt="Rotation 4 animation" />
<img src="img/projects/gumball/rotation_5.gif" alt="Rotation 5 animation" />
</div>

<p>
  As I was testing the machine out, I noticed that for the "gumball" size I have, the
  disk holes were too deep and therefore allowed two "gumballs" to go into a single hole.
  However, this caused a problem when turning the disk because the second top "gumball"
  would poke above the hole and get caught on the cardboard above it as the disk tries
  to turn.
</p>

<div class="projectsindividualoneimg">
<img src="img/projects/gumball/holedeep.jpg" alt="Disk hole is too deep" />
</div>

<p>
  Another mistake I noticed was that I had placed a tooth at the center of both the
  closed part and open holes of the disk. Therefore, when the spur gear turned the disk,
  the disk stopped slightly offset from the center of the closed portion or the open hole.
  I should have aligned the center with a gap between the teeth.
</p>

<div class="projectsindividualoneimg">
<img src="img/projects/gumball/teethwronglocation.jpg" alt="Teeth alignment mistake" />
</div>

<p>
  I decided to finish off the project by decorating the exterior with paper and covering up gaps.
  I realized that the weight of the paper balls acting as gumballs made the gears stall, and therefore
  in order for the system to function better I would need to invest more time in strengthening the
  gears. Now that I understand a lot of what needs to go in the design, I will try and remake this with a
  better plan in the future.
